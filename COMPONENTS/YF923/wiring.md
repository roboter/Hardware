# Wiring — YF923 (unknown component)

- No datasheet included. Use caution when connecting.
- Steps:
  1. Inspect silkscreen and labels for VCC/GND/SIG pins.
  2. Measure pin voltages with a multimeter (no power connected first to confirm continuity and pin mapping).
  3. Start with a current-limited power supply when powering unknown parts.
- Safety:
  - If you find markings on an IC or component, search for the part number online and retrieve the proper datasheet before applying signals.
