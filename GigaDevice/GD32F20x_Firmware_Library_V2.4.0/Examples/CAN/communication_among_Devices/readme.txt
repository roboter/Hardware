  This demo is based on the GD32207i-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows how to configure the CAN 
peripheral to send and receive CAN frames in normal mode.The frames are sent and print
transmit data by pressing Tamper Key. When the frames are received, the receive data 
will be printed and the LED2 will toggle.
 
  This example is tested with at least two GD32207i-EVAL-V1.2 boards. The same program example 
is loaded in all boards and connect CAN_L and CAN_H pin of CAN0 or CAN1 to bus for sending 
and receiving frames.

  User can select CAN0 or CAN1 cell using the private defines in main.c.
