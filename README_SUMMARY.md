# Progress Summary — Automated README & wiring.md creation

This file summarizes recent automated updates across the repository:

- Added `wiring.md` files to many folders to provide wiring/power/programming guidance.
- Updated several `readme.md` files to mention `wiring.md` and include images where available.
- Processed folders: EINK, Arduino, AVR, CH582F, COMPONENTS, Cypress, Displays, ESP, GigaDevice, IC, Modules (updated top-level index), NORDIC, NXP, Power Supply D-30A, PROJECTS, Raspberry, SHIELDS, Soldering KIT, STM32.

Next steps:
- Continue processing remaining top-level folders and add/standardize README + wiring files.
- Optionally generate simple SVG wiring diagrams for frequently used modules (if requested).

If you'd like me to continue through the rest of the repository now, say "continue" and I will proceed non-stop, reporting progress in batches.
