# Wiring — Multi Function Shield

- Plug directly onto a compatible Arduino (UNO-style headers) aligning the pins.
- Uses standard Arduino 5V logic on UNO; check the shield for jumpers to select 5V/3.3V where applicable.
- Pins:
  - 7-segment display and LEDs connected via digital pins; potentiometer to an analog input.
- Safety:
  - Verify shield voltage selection before plugging into 3.3V or 5V boards.
