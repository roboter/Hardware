# Wiring — HITACHI LM032 series

- Refer to `LM032L.PDF` for exact pinout and interface type (parallel or serial).
- Power and contrast control must follow the datasheet; do not exceed absolute maximum ratings.
- If the module uses a parallel interface, connect RS, RW, E, and data lines per the datasheet and use a contrast potentiometer for VO.

> Note: Use the datasheet for timing-specific initialization and for recommended power-up sequences.
