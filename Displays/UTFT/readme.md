# UTFT

UTFT is a graphics library for various color TFT displays. This folder contains examples and board-specific configs (Embeetle config for Mega 2560 etc.).

## Wiring

See each example or board-specific folder for wiring instructions; color TFTs often use parallel or 8/16-bit interfaces and require multiple data/control lines and appropriate voltage levels.

> Note: Refer to the UTFT project documentation for wiring examples matching your display and microcontroller.
