## General information

NANO V3 based on the ATmega328 microcontrollers has a small size and can be used together with model boards for solderless wiring (breadboard). It has the similar structure with Arduino Uno/Duemilanove, but different size and with additional Analog In A6, A7. To reduce the size, components are mounted on both sides of the PCB.

The board uses a chip CH340G as converter UART-USB. Chip CH340G – is a budget solution. With an operating frequency in 12Mhz, yields a stable result of a data interchange.

NANO V3 can be powered via microUSB-port (up to 500mA). External power supply 6-9V unregulated to output VIN, or 5V external power source to a regulated output of 5V. The power supply is automatically selected with the maximum voltage value.
Comparison with no-name

Quartz resonators are more reliable, stable and accurate in comparison with small ceramic ones.

In fact, Micro USB is more convenient and common, do not spend extra money for Mini USB cable. Use a Micro smartphones USB cable.

The auto-resettable fuse protects the USB ports of the computer and the Nano V3 from breakdown and statistical currents. On no-name boards are not installed.
