&par Example Description

Through The computer of serial debugging assistant, display the message sent
and received between the MCU and USART1.

The phenomenon of serial assistant can display information from USART1 and debug information of USART2.

  - USART1 and USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

&par Directory contents

  - USART/USART_Interrupt/Source/apm32f0xx_int.c     Interrupt handlers
  - USART/USART_Interrupt/Source/main.c              Main program

&par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on APM32F030 or APM32F072 MINI Devices.
