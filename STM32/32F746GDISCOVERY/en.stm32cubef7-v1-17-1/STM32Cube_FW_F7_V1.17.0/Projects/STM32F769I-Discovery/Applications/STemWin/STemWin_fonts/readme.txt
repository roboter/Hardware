@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement a simple "fonts" 
application based on STemWin for STM32F7xx devices.

The application shows the capability of STemWin to display different languages 
with different fonts styles and sizes.

The used fonts are not part of the fonts shipped with STemWin. 
The fonts are generated with Font converter tool.

To display Unicode characters, we need to save the text with the needed language in UTF-8 format, 
convert UTF-8 text into C code and generate the adueqate font that to be used in the main application.

Detailed steps:

Saving the text in UTF-8 format
-------------------------------
- Save the text with the needed language in "UTF-8" format. (you can use Notepad.exe)
- Using U2C software tool, converts "UTF-8" text into C code 
  (U2C software available under "Middlewares/ST/STemWin/Software") 
- copy the generated C code in the main application

pattern generation
------------------
To optimize as possible the generated fonts sizes we can generate only the used characters, 
for this, we have to save the text file (containing the text to be displayed) in "unicode" format 

Font generation
---------------
 - Opens font converter tool (available under "Middlewares/ST/STemWin/Software")
 - choose the adequate font (depending on the choosen language)
 - disable all characters ranges (Edit/Disable all characters)
 - load the generated pattern (text.txt saved as "unicode" format)
 - save the font
 ==> only used characters in text.txt file are generated.
 - include the font

 @note for arabic fonts the following ranges needs to be activated:
  - 600 -> 6FF
  - FE80 -> FEFC
  
 How to interact with the application
 ------------------------------------
 - Press on top right button to select the language and highlight the displayed text.
 - Press on bottom button to shows more information about the application.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
