@par Application Description 

This application shows how to use the different functionalities of Audio device 
and ST MEMS microphones (MP34DT01), use touch screen to enter into playback or record menu

1) Explorer Audio File menu.
This menu is used to display wave files stored in the USB Key. Touch the screen 
anywhere, except play or record buttons, to explore the content of the USB key

2) Audio playback menu (Need headphone).
In playback menu, any wave file stored under the USB Key can be opened using the FatFs 
file system and transferred to the internal SRAM using the file system. All the wave
files properties are read from the Wave File Header.
Plug a headphone to hear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears. Default volume is 70%.

To play the audio file, a buffer is used between USB and audio codec. This buffer 
is used like a ping-pong buffer to be able to read regularly data from USB to be 
sent to audio codec: 
- Using FatFs driver, a 1st read of AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE bytes is done
- This buffer is sent to audio BSP which uses DMA mode to transfer data from MCU
to audio codec (16 bits)
- At DMA half transfer ISR, an indication is sent to application to indicate that
half of the buffer has been sent
- At DMA half transfer ISR exit, application can read (AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE/2) bytes from USB to fill
the 1st part of the buffer
- At DMA transfer complete ISR, DMA transfer is requested to send 1st part of the
buffer
- At DMA transfer complete ISR exit, application can read (AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE/2) bytes from USB to fill
the 2nd part of the buffer
- When file size is reached, audio codec is stopped and a new play is requested.

A touch screen interface is used to navigate from a file to another (Next and Previous buttons), 
to change volume, pause playback and to quit playback menu by pressing Stop button.

Note: The audio files provided under "/Utilities/Media/Audio" are based on a free 
music download from www.DanoSongs.com website and user can load his own audio 
(*.wav) files in the USB Key root.
 
3) Audio recorder menu:
Two MEMS microphone MP34DT01 mounted on STM32F769I_DISCOVERY are connected
to the DFSDM peripheral. The DFSDM Filters/Cannels are configured to get data from
the MEMS microphones. Once recorded, the data can be played using SAI periphiral.

Data acquisition is performed in 16KHz and 16-bit and DMA is used to transfer 
data from DFSDM peripheral to internal SRAM. In order to avoid data-loss, one buffer
split into two halves is used:

When the first half of the buffer is filled (half transfer complete), the recorded PCM
samples are written to USB Key while the second half of the buffer is being
used to receive data from Audio samples.

When the second half of the buffer is filled (transfer complete), the recorded PCM
samples are written to USB Key while the first half of the buffer is being
used to receive data from Audio samples. This process is repeated as long as the 
application is running.

To avoid data corruption:
- DMA ISR priority must be set at a Lower priority than USB interrupt sources,
  this priority order must be respected when managing other interrupts;

In main loop of the application, when a buffer is full with PCM format it is written
in USB key using the free file system FatFS.

A touch screen interface is used to launch record process, pause record and to quit 
record menu by pressing Stop button.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F769xx/STM32F779xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STM32F769I_DISCOVERY board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.   

  - STM32F769I_DISCOVERY Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM32F769I_DISCOVERY board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable (HS mode: connector CN15).
    - Connect a headphone to connector CN7.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
