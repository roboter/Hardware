@par Application Description 

This application describes how  to run an SSL client application based on mbedTLS
crypto library and LwIP TCP/IP stack.

Scenario 1:
===========
In this screnario the client (STM32F769I-Discovery):
- connects to local network either through DHCP or static IP address.
- establishes a secured connected to the Host PC Server.
- sends an encrypted message to the server.
- receives an answser from the server.

Scenario 2:
===========
In this second scenario, the the client (STM32F769I-Discovery):
- connects to local network either through DHCP or static IP address.
- establishes a secured connected to a second STM32F769I-Discovery borad running 
  the "SSL_Sever" application.
- sends an encrypted message to the second board.
- receives an answser from the server board.

Application logs are displayed on the LCD.

In case of sucess the green led is toggling.
In case of errors the red led is loggling.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

For more details about this application, refer to UM1723 "STM32Cube mbedTLS application".

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx Devices.
  
  - This application has been tested with two scenarios.
     - Using a Host PC as server, running a Fedora 23 operating System or similar.
	 - Using a Windows PC as server, running Windows 7 operating system or later.
     - using two STM32F769I_Discovery boards the first as server, the second as client.
  
  - Senario 1:
      - Remote PC Set-up
	  - Make sure that the PC is in the same local network as the baord.
	  - Using a Linux Machine
         - Download the mebedTLS source code from (https://tls.mbed.org/download/start/mbedtls-2.4.0-apache.tgz)
	     - build the mbedTLS package following the instructions in the https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls#make
	     - Once done, run the server application "programs/ssl/ssl_server".
	  - Using a Windows Machine
	    - Follow the instructions in the file "Firmware\Utilities\PC_Software\ssl_server\readme.txt" to run the ssl_server application.
	  - the "ssl_server" will wait for remote connections.

  - Senario 2:
      - a second STM32F769I_Discovery running the "mdedTLS/SSL_Server" application
  
  - STM32F769I-Discovery Set-up 
    - Connect STM32F769I_Discovery to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable).
   
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - edit the file "main.h" setup the correct "SERVER_NAME"
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application.

 @Note: 1) Please ensure that the remote PC IP address is the same IP address
           as the one defined in main.h in the "SERVER_NAME", and the port number
		   used for the connection is the same as the one defined in "SERVER_PORT"
		  
        2) If using two boards for testing and the DHCP is enabled then the "SSL_Server" needs to be
		   run first, to get the board IP Address and use it in the "SSL_Client" application.
