# LVGL ported to the STM32F429 Discovery.

The [STM32F429 Discovery kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) is an affordable development board with:
* 240x320 (QVGA) TFT
* Resistive touchscreen
* 180 MHz MCU
* 256KB RAM
* 64-MBit SDRAM
* GPU.

The CubeMX drivers are used to initilaize the peripherals. 

In `hal_stm_lvgl/tft/tft.h` you can enable/disable external frame buffer placement and GPU usage. 

The project was created with CubeIDE.

## Get started
