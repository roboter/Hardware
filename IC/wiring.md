# Handling & wiring notes — IC datasheets

- These folders contain datasheets (OP290, TMC222). For wiring and usage:
  - Always consult the specific datasheet for pinouts, recommended operating conditions, and application circuits.
  - Use proper decoupling capacitors and follow recommended PCB layout for analog and high-current ICs.
  - For motor drivers (e.g., TMC222), ensure correct current settings, heat sinking, and MOSFET/diode protection where required.
- Safety:
  - Observe absolute maximum ratings and thermal limits to avoid damage.

> Note: If you need a quick reference for a specific IC application, provide which IC and I can add a short example wiring diagram.
