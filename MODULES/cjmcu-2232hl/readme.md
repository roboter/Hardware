 FT2232HL USB TURN UART/FIFO/SPI/I2C/JTAG/RS232 module FT2232HL CJMCU-2232HL
The FT2232H is FTDI’s 5thgeneration of USB devices. The FT2232H is a USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mb/s) to UART/FIFO IC. It has the capability of being configured in a variety of industry standard serial or parallel interfaces.
Parameter

    Module USB supply voltage: DC5V;

    USB 2.0 full speed compatible.

    Built-in 3.3V / 1.8V LDO regulator.

    Extended operating temperature range: -40°C to 85°C

    20-pin SSOP and QFN packages (RoHS compliant).

    Compatible with UHCI / OHCI / EHCI host controllers.

    Integrated power-on-reset circuit.

    The data transfer rate is 1 megabyte per second.

    Each chip has a pre-programmed unique USB serial number.

    Supports bus-powered, self-powered and high-power bus-powered USB configurations.

    Built-in + 3.3V level shifter for USB I/O.

    Built-in + 3.3V level shifter for USB I/O.

    True 3.3V CMOS driver output and TTL input. (The operating voltage drops to 1V8 through an external pull-up resistor)

    The I/O voltage level is from 1.8V to 3.3V (withstand voltage to 5V). The drive current of the I/O pin can be configured.

    The entire USB protocol is processed on this chip and does not require USB-specific firmware programming.

    FT1248 serial parallel interface in 1, 2, 4, or 8-bit mode. Similar to the SPI slave 1-bit mode.

    Integrated 2048-byte multiple-programmable (MTP) memory for storage device descriptions and CBUS I/O configuration.

    An integrated clock generator eliminates the need for an external crystal and has a clock output option for seamless connection to an external MCU or FPGA.

    A 512-byte receive buffer and a 512-byte transmit buffer enable high data throughput with buffering.

    Battery charger detection. Mobile devices can use it to detect the presence of a charger on the USB port for higher current/faster\

    Charge the battery quickly.

    8 mA (typ) of low operating current and 125 μA (typ) of USB suspend current. Low USB bandwidth consumption.

    FTDI royalty-free virtual COM port (VCP) and direct (D2XX) drivers are exempt from USB drivers in most cases

    Development requirements.
