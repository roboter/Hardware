# UMFT200Xd

FT232EX

Have 1 configurable PIN 
 * CB0 I/O Configurable CBUS0 I/O Pin. Function of this pin is configured in the device internal MTP ROM. See CBUS Signal Options, Table 3.3
 * CBUS bit bang mode option. A separate application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com) describes in more detail how to use CBUS bit bang mode
 
 
 Does not mention `MPSSE` in documents
 
 
 
 
 The FT200XD's highly integrated USB-to-IIC bridge integrates a USB 2.0 full-speed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator and a CBUS0 pin. The chip is an I2C slave device that selects all customization and configuration options via a simple GUI-based configurator, a standard HID class device that processes the entire USB protocol on-chip without the need for USB-specific firmware programming. Fast USB connectivity with minimal development effort.Product Parameters
