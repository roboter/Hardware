## Pin description:
1 VIN : Charging port +
2 GND : Charging port -
3 BAT : Battery port +
4 GND : Battery port -
5 GND : Output port -
6 VOUT: Output port +
7 KEY : Output trigger port(Low pulse trigger)
 
1 In discharge mode(In the charging mode,the KEY function is invalid),
the KEY Trigger once,turn on the output;Continuous trigger twice: turn off the output.
 
2 When the load access, it will automatically turn on the output.
But if the load is less than 50MA, the output will be turned off after 30 seconds
 
 
NOTE:
If the output load current is less than 50MA, turn off the output after 30 seconds.
If the output load current is greater than 50MA,continuous turn on the output
This module is not suitable for uninterruptible power supply(ups),If you need the UPS module,Click here to buy
