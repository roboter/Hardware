# Wiring — NXP FRDM boards

- Power:
  - FRDM boards typically run at 3.3V supplied from USB or external sources.
- Programming & Debugging:
  - Use CMSIS-DAP/OpenOCD/SWD for debugging and programming where available.
- Pins:
  - Check board schematics in each subfolder for exact header pinouts and connector mappings.
- Safety:
  - Verify voltage levels when connecting external peripherals and avoid short-circuiting debug connectors.

> Note: See each FRDM board folder for schematics and example projects.
