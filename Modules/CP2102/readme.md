2.FT232RL USB to serial module USB to TTL level, USB2TTL protection version supports overcurrent protection version;
3.This product uses a brand new design and uses the FT232RL chip of USB 2.0 to convert USB into a serial port. There are two power supply versions available;
4.Each module passed the test of spontaneously collecting 10W bytes before leaving the factory;
5.Upgrade the TYPE-C interface power supply, support 3.3V 5V downloader burning cable, and choose between 5V or 3.3V interface levels.

## Introduction to FT232R:
With the development of computer technology, parallel and serial ports have gradually disappeared on PCs, and even desktop computers now have few parallel ports. But for engineers, both parallel and serial ports are essential interfaces, especially serial ports. For computers without serial ports, the most convenient solution is to use a USB to serial port chip to create a virtual serial port. Many manufacturers have produced such chips, such as Silicon LABS's CP210x series, TI's TUSB3410 series, Nanjing Qinheng's CH34x series, FTDI's FT232 series, Prolific's PL230x series, Aike's ARK3116, and so on. From a stability perspective, the FT232 series is still the most reliable and can be used to debug programs with peace of mind without worrying about blue screen issues.
The FT232R chip is a single chip solution that generally does not require external devices. The crystal oscillator, USB matching resistor, and EEPROM for storing product information are already integrated internally. FT232R also has some useful functions, please refer to the FT232R data manual for specific details.

# Introduction to CP2102 Moudle:
## Features:
1. Easy to use, the module comes with pin headers, but does not need to be welded. When it is convenient to use, you can weld it by yourself according to your personal needs;
2.CP2102 module, upgrades TYPE-C interface to TTL, supports USB to serial port, and supports UART STC downloader;
3.CP2102 has high integration and built-in USB2.0 full-speed function controller, USB transceiver, crystal oscillator, EEPROM and asynchronous serial data bus (UART);
4. Supports full-function modem signals without any external USB devices;
5. The working principle of CJMCU-CP2102 is similar to other USB-UART adapter circuits. The USB port of the PC is virtualized into a COM port through the driver to achieve expansion purposes.
Product Description:
CJMCU-Attitude module communication USB to TTL module 5V power output TTL level CP2102 core CJMCU-CP2102 is a highly integrated USB-UART bridge that can provide a simple solution to realize RS232 conversion to USB using minimized components and PCB space plan. To put it simply: users can use CJMCU-CP2102 to convert the USB interface to the RS232 interface.
Module description:
1. Using 2102 chip, the COM port is generated after installing the driver.
2. Connect the standard TYPE-C line input to the computer USB interface, with two power outputs of 3.3V and 5V voltage.
3. Onboard status indicator light and transceiver indicator light. After the driver is installed correctly, the status indicator light will be always on. The transceiver indicator light will flash during communication, with a running LED indicator light.
4. Support baud rate from 300bps to 1Mbps
5. Communication format support: 1) 5, 6, 7, 8 data bits; 2) Support 1, 1.5, 2 stop bits; 3) odd, even, mark, space, none check
6. Support operating system: windows 8.1/7/vista/xp/98, Mac OS-X/OS-9
7. The USB socket interface is TYPE-C-USB socket
8. SMD components are welded by regular companies, with stable quality and beautiful appearance.
9. With DTR trigger signal output, it can directly communicate with pro mini ATMEGA328P and other motherboards by downloading programs.
10. Module size: 16mm*20mm, super small.
