## YS-CH341T

The `YS-CH341T` Dongle has drivers that allow it to run on a range of Windows operating systems. It has been tested on XP, XP-x64, W7, W7-x64, W8.1, W8.1-x64. W10 and W10-x64. Although the drivers run on both 32 and 64bit systems, the JNI libraries are only available for Java 32bit VMs. Although source code is available, Windows is currently the only OS supported.
