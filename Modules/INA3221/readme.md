# INA3221 Triple-Channel Shunt Monitor

**Short description**
The INA3221 is a triple-channel current/power monitor with I2C interface. Useful for monitoring multiple rails or battery pack segments.

**Key notes**
- Interface: I2C
- Channels: three independent shunt monitors
- Typical usage: measure voltage across sense resistors and read via I2C

**Wiring**
See `wiring.md` in this folder for I2C wiring and shunt resistor suggestions.

**Notes**
- Add appropriate sense resistors (e.g., 0.01–0.1 Ω) for expected current range.
- Confirm module's I2C address and power voltage before use.
