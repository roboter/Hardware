# MH-CD42 DC 5V 2.1A Mobile Power Module

**Short description**
Compact 5 V boost / mobile power module intended to work with a single 3.7 V Li-ion cell (eg. 18650). Typical use is portable USB power for small devices and microcontroller boards.

**Typical features (verify on your board)**
- Input (BAT): 3.7–4.2 V single-cell Li-ion
- Output (VOUT): 5 V boost, up to ~2.1 A (depends on module/board condition)
- Protections: may include overcurrent, overvoltage, short-circuit protection (check component markings)

**Suggested pinout (confirm on board)**
- VIN / BAT + : battery positive
- GND : common ground
- VOUT / 5V : boosted 5 V output
- KEY / EN : optional enable or load trigger pin (if present)

**Notes / Safety**
- This README is a general summary based on the module type. Please verify pin labels and voltages with a multimeter before connecting sensitive devices.
- If you can provide measured voltages and any text from silkscreen/IC markings, I can update this file with precise specs.

*Add any photos of pin labels or measurements to this folder to make the documentation complete.*
