# AA / AAA Li-ion Adapter (3.7–4.2 V → ~1.5 V)

**Short description**
This adapter allows using a single Li-ion cell (typically 18650) as a substitute for AA/AAA cells by reducing the voltage to approximately 1.5 V. It is useful for legacy devices that expect ~1.5 V disposable cells.

**Usage**
- Insert the Li-ion cell with correct polarity into the adapter.
- Measure the adapter output (Vout) before connecting to your device — verify it is within expected voltage range for your device.
- Do NOT use this adapter in devices that charge AA/AAA cells unless the adapter explicitly supports charging.

**Notes / Safety**
- This is an adapter, not a battery chemistry converter for charging — batteries should be charged with a proper Li-ion charger, not by the host device unless explicitly supported.
- Some devices expect specific characteristics of AA/AAA cells (internal resistance, capacity); performance may vary.

*If you have photos of the adapter PCB (solder pads / traces) or measured voltages under load, add them here and I will update this README with more precise guidance.*
