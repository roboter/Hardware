# Wiring — AA/AAA Li-ion Adapter

This adapter reduces a single Li-ion cell voltage to ~1.5 V output for devices expecting AA/AAA cells.

Connections:
- Insert Li-ion cell into adapter orientation (observe the + and - marks)
- Adapter output pads correspond to the AA/AAA terminal ends (+ and -)

Quick checks:
- Measure adapter output (no-load) to confirm ~1.5 V.
- Measure under a light load to confirm regulation behavior.

Safety:
- Do not attempt to charge the Li-ion cell through the device unless the adapter explicitly supports charging.
- Confirm polarity before inserting into consumer devices.
