# Product Description:

When you do some ESP32 projects you must hate to add a power bank to provide the power. This tiny board could solve such problems.
A 3000mAH 18650 battery could make ESP32run 17 hours or more.
18650 charging system integrated.
Indicate LED inside(Green means full& Red means charging)
Charging and working could be at the same time.
1 Switch could control the power.
1 extra LED could be programmed(Connected with GPIO16[D0])
0.5A charging current
1A output
Over charge protection
Over discharge protection
Full ESP32 pins out

# OLED

Unlike on other ESP32 boards with OLEDs, the OLED's I2C SDA and SCL pins are connected as follows:

* SCL - Pin 4
* SDA - Pin 5

```
SSD1306Wire display(0x3c, OLED_SDA, OLED_SCL);
```
It does not require an "enable" signal on GPIO16 as suggested in some programs I found. So comment these out if you see them.

# Upload

* turn off
* hold boot putton
* wait for upload
* turn on
* release boot button

2 option

* just holding boot button
* release on upload process

# HARDWARE

```c
#define KEY 0
#define LED 16
SSD1306Wire display(0x3c, 5, 4, GEOMETRY_128_64);
```
