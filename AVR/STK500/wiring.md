# Wiring — STK500

- Use standard ISP/parallel connector as documented in `AVR068STK500CommunicationProtocol.pdf`.
- Ensure target microcontroller VCC matches the programmer/settings when using the STK500.
- Consult `doc1925.pdf` for hardware-specific connector pinouts and signal names.

> Note: The STK500 is a legacy development kit — follow the communication protocol guide for correct usage.
