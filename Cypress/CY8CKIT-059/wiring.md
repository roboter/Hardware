  - SWD/JTAG headers may be available for external debuggers.
- Pins:
  - Consult kit documentation for pin mappings and analog/digital routing features of PSoC.
- Safety:
  - Avoid powering from multiple sources simultaneously and verify voltage rails with a multimeter before applying logic signals.
